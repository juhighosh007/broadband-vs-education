<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This scrollytelling project explores the powerful link between broadband access and educational achievement in Black communities. Using data from various counties in the U.S., it reveals how limited internet connectivity correlates with lower college degree attainment. Interactive visuals - scatterplots, bar charts - let users trace how connection (or disconnection) can shape futures. Ultimately, it asks: when opportunity depends on Wiâ€‘Fi, what happens to those left offline?
